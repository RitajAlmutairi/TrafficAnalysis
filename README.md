# TrafficAnalysis
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing traffic data and traffic accident data. The analyses include calculating various statistics, visualizing distributions, and exploring relationships between different variables.  
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
  You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

```
## Notebooks
1.  Traffic_and_Accidents.ipynb  
  This notebook performs EDA on traffic accident data to calculate statistics and visualize the distribution of casualties, the relationship between the number of vehicles involved and the number of casualties, and the correlation between different numerical columns.
2. Traffic_Analysis.ipynb  
   This notebook performs an analysis on traffic data to visualize the distribution.

### Steps: 
1. Import Libraries: Import the necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization.  
2. Load Dataset: Read the traffic_accidents.csv file into a pandas DataFrame.  
3. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and clean the data.  
4. Calculate Statistics
5. Visualizations
